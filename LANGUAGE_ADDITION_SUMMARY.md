### 3. Translation Files Created

**Files:**

## How to Test

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 2. Test Language Switcher

  - 🇺🇸 English
  - 🇸🇦 العربية
  - 🇫🇷 Français
  - 🇹🇷 Türkçe (NEW)

## Next Steps

### 1. Professional Translation Required
The new translation files (tr.json, id.json, de.json) currently contain English text as placeholders. They need to be translated by:
- Native speakers, OR
- Professional translation services

**Structure:** Keep the exact same JSON structure and keys, only translate the values.

### 2. Translation Priority
Consider translating in this order:
1. Common sections (navigation, buttons, forms)
2. Home page content
3. Brochure content
4. About page
5. Services pages
6. Contact information

### 3. RTL Support (if needed)
Turkish, Indonesian, and German use left-to-right (LTR) text direction, so no RTL changes needed. Current Arabic (RTL) support remains unchanged.
