      "description1": "Arabian Eagle International is not just a new way to promote your business and services, but it is unique in being, in fact, the first card company specialized in serving travelers from the Arabian Peninsula and other Arab countries, thus providing you with the opportunity to reach a wide audience with high income.",
      "description2": "In several areas it is similar to other travel cards, widely used in terms of services and benefits provided to both the cardholder and the supply company. But what differs is that Arabian Eagle International has established and designed its services for one of the world's highest available incomes for each market individually... specifically the Arab world, especially the Arabian Peninsula.",
      "description3": "In recent years, Arabs and immigrants to the Arab world have become frequent international travelers who use hotels and car rental companies more than their counterparts in other geographical regions. In fact, travelers from the Arab world spend more than one hundred and ten billion US dollars per year on travel. This is the market that Arabian Eagle International offers you to promote your own business.",
      "description4": "And you, as a business partner, can benefit from Arabian Eagle's business vision and services provided to our members once you become a partner. All you need to do is give us information about your business, services and offers as a partner, and we will ensure that your business goals and company aspirations will be achieved with business growth that exceeds your expectations.",
      "description5": "The extensive member program and our ability to enter markets has made us one of the best pioneering companies in the travel industry. Our members, who exceed twenty-eight thousand, enjoy a number of services and most of them have been with us since the establishment of our business. By becoming a business partner, you will increase your customer base through our 42,000 members, use our members' marketing care team and our facilities to promote your services. A major step in business development that would normally take years to achieve, you can now accomplish with just a few clicks of a button.",
      "description6": "Arabian Eagle International aims to enhance its services for its affiliated members and increase its business alliances from various countries around the world. Arabian Eagle International has gained the trust and loyalty of its members and keeps its business growth steadfast and strict, but this is what you will also do as a business partner. Arabian Eagle will not benefit from you as a member as much as you will benefit from it."
